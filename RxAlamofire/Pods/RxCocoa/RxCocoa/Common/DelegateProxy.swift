    Returns observable sequence of invocations of delegate methods. Elements are sent *before method is invoked*.

    Only methods that have `void` return value can be observed using this method because
     those methods are used as a notification mechanism. It doesn't matter if they are optional
     or not. Observing is performed by installing a hidden associated `PublishSubject` that is 
     used to dispatch messages to observers.

    Delegate methods that have non `void` return value can't be observed directly using this method
     because:
     * those methods are not intended to be used as a notification mechanism, but as a behavior customization mechanism
     * there is no sensible automatic way to determine a default return value

    In case observing of delegate methods that have return type is required, it can be done by
     manually installing a `PublishSubject` or `BehaviorSubject` and implementing delegate method.
     
     e.g.
     
         // delegate proxy part (RxScrollViewDelegateProxy)

         let internalSubject = PublishSubject<CGPoint>
     
         public func requiredDelegateMethod(scrollView: UIScrollView, arg1: CGPoint) -> Bool {

             let proxy = RxScrollViewDelegateProxy.proxyForObject(base)

         }

     **In case calling this method prints "Delegate proxy is already implementing `\(selector)`, 
     a more performant way of registering might exist.", that means that manual observing method 
     is required analog to the example above because delegate method has already been implemented.**
